# Competitive Programming

A list of exercises and small problems with optimal solutions for the Competitive Programming & Contests course held by Rossano Venturini at the University of Pisa.

There are 2 folders:
- `exercises`
- `hands-on`

### Exercises

The exercises are selected by the professors. Most of them come from LeetCode and other competitive programming platforms. Here's what the `exercises` folder contains:
